    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hot spinach dip is rich, cheesy, and incredibly deliciousâ€”without the usual mayo or sour cream. Every time I make it, people ask for the recipe! If you prefer a milder flavor, you can swap out the Cheddar for another cheese or omit it entirely. I like using Cheddar because it adds both color and extra flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, dividied</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen spinach - thawed, drained, and chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>6 ounces cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 dashes Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
